# KiKad_RH_Library
Library for KiKad 7.0 symbols and footprints

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to store my personal KiKad symbols and footprints, if they are helpful to anyone else please feel free to use them.

The components have been designed using mils as the units designed for a 50mil grid schematic.
